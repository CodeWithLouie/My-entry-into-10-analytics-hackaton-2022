# Health Crisis in Nigeria (Case Study) {#sec-health-crisis-in-nigeria}

**This project is part of my entry into the 10nalytics hackton 2022**

## Project Overview

-   Imported the dataset from multiple csv files

-   Cleaned and transformed the data using the dplyr package

-   Joined tables for multi-table analysis

-   Visualize findings using ggplot

## Problem Statement

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and has the largest GDP. Unfortunately, the nation has been plagued by subpar medical facilities, which may be as a result of inadequate investments in the country's healthcare system leading to the mass migration of medical personnel overseas for greener pastures.

## Question Answered by the Analysis

This analysis will answer the following questions as regarding the health situation in Nigeria.

1.  What are age bracket has the highest death rate in the world?
2.  What is the health expenditure in each continents of the world?
3.  Which continent has the lowest population of doctor as a percentage of its population?
4.  What is the doctor population in Nigeria?
5.  What is the health expenditure in Nigeria?
6.  What is the leading causes of deaths in the World?
7.  What is the leading causes of deaths in Nigeria?
8.  What age group is responsible for the most deaths in Nigeria?

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

You can find the code of this project in the **tackling_health_crisis_in_africa.R** file.

## Insights

It was seen that people aged 70 and above accounted for the most recorded deaths in the world, which is likely a normal trend of deaths for the older generation. On the other hand, Africa health expenditure seems to be the least progressive of all continents with an average spending below 6 percent of its GDP. It is no surprise that a continent with a mediocre health expenditure turned out with the lowest do ctor population below 1 percent of its population. This brings us to the next question, "what is the doctor population of Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria?"

Data from 2000 to 2022 shows that the number of doctors in Nigeria has been below **100,000**. For a country with over 200 million people, how does this number meets the daily healthcare demand of the country? Additionally, the health expenditure has been declining over the last two decades with a little improvements from 2013 to 2016 followed by a steep decline from 2016 onward.

The 3 leading causes of deaths in the world since 2000 is Cardiovascular diseases, Neoplasms, and Chronic respiratory diseases, but given the situation, that is far from Nigeria's biggest health worries. For Nigeria, the top 3 leading causes of death is Diarrhea, Malaria, and Lower respiratory infections. Diarrhea and malaria are deadliest for younger children especially those below the age of 10. This is valid when we look at the age group with the most reported deaths in Nigeria. Children aged 5 and under took a have a significant higher chances of dying than an other age groups.

From the above findings, it can be said that Nigeria is far behind in the advancement of its health sector compared to other countries. The government has a lot of work to do in providing adequate health facilities in the country.

## Recommendations

1.  The Government of Nigeria should increase the allocation of funds to the health sector to increase the quality of medical care being given to its citizens.
2.  Increase incentives of medical personnel to halt the mass exodus of workers out of the country.
3.  Place more emphasis on primary healthcare especially those in rural areas as this is where the most hits are recorded.
4.  Put in place measures that will curb the spread of Diarrhea, Malaria and other leading causes of deaths in the country.

## Appreciation 

These analysis was carried out as part of my entry into the 10Anlytics Hackaton 2022 from 3-4th December 2022. It was organized by 10Alytics and Mustard Insights in Nigeria.

My sincere appreciation goes to the 10Anlytics and Mustard Insights team for giving me the opportunity to work on this project.
