# Health Crisis in Nigeria (Case Study) {#sec-health-crisis-in-nigeria}

**This project is part of my entry into the 10nalytics hackton 2022**

## Project Overview

-   Imported the dataset from multiple csv files

-   Cleaned and transformed the data using the dplyr package

-   Joined tables for multi-table analysis

-   Visualize findings using ggplot

## Problem Statement

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and has the largest GDP. Unfortunately, the nation has been plagued by subpar medical facilities, which may be a result of inadequate investments in the country's healthcare system leading to the mass migration of medical personnel overseas for greener pastures.

The dataset used in this analysis was provided by 10Alytics and Mustard Insights for the 2022 data analytics hackaton.
