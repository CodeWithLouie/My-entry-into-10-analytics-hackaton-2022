## Nigeria

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and has the largest GDP. Unfortunately, the nation has been plagued by subpar medical facilities, which may be a result of inadequate investments in the country's healthcare system.

This project examines the numerous causes of the health issue in Nigeria before comparing it to the rest of the world.

### Health Expenditure by Continent

The general advancement of facilities will benefit from investments made in the medical industry in any given nation. Nigerians in particular are known to go outside of Africa to receive medical care, most likely in the US and UK. The average expenditures for each continent as a share of GDP are displayed in the graph below.

According to the graph above, from 2000 to 2022, Africa's investment in health was fairly over 5% of its GDP. This trend in health spending has not changed. The continent with the fewest doctors is Africa, as can also be shown.

### Nigeria Health Expenditure and Doctor Population

Since 2000, Nigeria's average health spending has been declining. This is troubling as seen by the recent exodus of medical professionals to foreign countries in pursuit of greener pastures. What remains of Nigeria's medical population, then, to address the country's struggling healthcare system?

Nigeria can be considered to be in a health crisis with a doctor population of less than 80,000 with the majority of death causes being children under the age of five.

In conclusion, the Nigerian government has a lot of work to do to ensure the protection of lives through the implementation of policies that will help lift the industry out of its depressing state and also increase the compensation of medical staff to reduce the migration of doctors out of the country, which is already putting more strain on the concerned sector.

Below are some recommendations:

1.  Implementing public health measures: This may include measures such as vaccination campaigns, quarantine and isolation measures, and public health education campaigns.

2.  Providing resources for healthcare: This may include providing funding for hospitals and other healthcare facilities, as well as supplying personal protective equipment and other necessary supplies to healthcare workers.
